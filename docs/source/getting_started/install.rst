Python Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``ansys.mapdl.core`` package currently supports Python 3.6 through
Python 3.8 on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Install the latest release from `PyPi
<https://pypi.org/project/ansys-mapdl-core/>`_ with:

.. code::

   pip install ansys.mapdl-core

Alternatively, install the latest from `PyMAPDL GitHub
<https://github.com/pyansys/pymapdl/issues>`_ via:

.. code::

   pip install git+https://github.com/pyansys/pymapdl.git


For a local "development" version, install with:

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/pyansys/pymapdl.git
   cd pymapdl
   pip install -e .

This will allow you to install the pymapdl ``ansys-mapdl-core`` module
and modify it locally and have the changes reflected in your setup
after restarting the Python kernel.


ANSYS Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the latest features, you will need a copy of ANSYS 2021R1
installed locally, but PyMAPDL is compatible with ANSYS 17.0 and newer
on Windows and 13.0 on Linux.

.. note::

    The latest versions of ANSYS provide signifiantly better support
    and features.  Certain features will not be supported by earlier
    versions of ANSYS (e.g. APDL Math).


Verifiy Your Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Check that you can start MAPDL from Python by running:

.. code:: python

    >>> from ansys.mapdl.core import launch_mapdl
    >>> mapdl = launch_mapdl()
    >>> print(mapdl)
